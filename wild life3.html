         <P>Bandhavgarh is not the most accessible national park in India, but it does have amongst the best chances of seeing a tiger in the wild (also high on the list are Ranthambore in Rajasthan near Delhi, and Tadoba in Maharashtra). For those who are longing to catch a glimpse of the great big cat, it's well worth the effort to go there. If you allow two days for safaris, you're likely to be successful. Many people see a tiger on the first safari.</P>
         <h1>Elephant: Nagarhole, Karnataka</h1>
         <P>Nagarhole gains its name from the snake-like river that winds its way through it. This park is a place of unspoiled wilderness, with serene forest, bubbling streams, and a tranquil lake. Nagarhole can be explored by jeep, elephant back, and boat. Visitors can also go trekking. It's not unusual to see herds of elephants on the river bank.</P>
         <h1>List of Wild Animals in India</h1>
         <p>Indian subcontinent has a rich and varied biodiversity to boast of. Infact, the country is home to some of the most rare as well as magnificent wild animals. Most of the wild animals of India are being protected from poaching as well as habitat loss through the numerous national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. Indian culture preaches respect for each and every form of life, including wildlife. Still, greedy individuals as well as the ever-increasing population are putting pressure on the peaceful existence of Indian wild animals. In this section, we have provided information on the following wild animals living in India:

        <h1>Monkey</h1>
        <img src="images (38).jpg">
       
        <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense; Catarrhini in the broad sense, which again includes apes).

            Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.
            
            Simians and tarsiers, the two members of the suborder Haplorhini, emerged some 60 million years ago. New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago. Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago. Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [35â€“32 million years ago] are also considered monkeys by primatologists.[3][4][5][6][7]
            
            Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini). The simians' sister group, the tarsiers are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.
            
            Apes emerged within "monkeys" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so "Old World monkey" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including apes).[8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.[17]
            
            Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.[18]</p>
